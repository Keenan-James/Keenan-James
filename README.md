# Tall Ship Sailing Simulator

<!--Summary -->
<p> 
With Tall Ships Sailing Simulator, my goal was to recreate the authentic experience of sailing to and discovering the Americas. I wanted players to feel the thrill of navigating a tall ship across vast seas, just as explorers did centuries ago. To achieve this, I designed a realistic tall ship sailing controller that immerses players in their role as a ship’s captain. But the adventure doesn’t stop at sea. Upon reaching land, players are greeted with a procedurally generated tropical island waiting to be explored. Each playthrough promises a unique experience, with different landscapes and weather conditions. This idea for this game is not just about reaching a destination; it’s about the journey itself and the thrill of discovery that comes with it. </p>
